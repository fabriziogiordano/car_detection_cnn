You can bundle your Python application, including the trained and scripted model, into a standalone executable so that you don't need Python or dependencies like a virtual environment (`.env`) on the target device (e.g., a Raspberry Pi). The typical approach is to use a tool like **PyInstaller**, **Nuitka**, or **PyOxidizer**. These tools convert your Python scripts and dependencies into a self-contained executable.

### Using PyInstaller to Bundle Your Application

Here's a step-by-step guide to using **PyInstaller** to create a standalone executable for your script:

#### Step 1: Install PyInstaller
First, ensure PyInstaller is installed on your development machine:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

#### Step 2: Create a Spec File
To bundle your script with PyInstaller, create a specification (`.spec`) file that defines how to package your script and any additional files (like the `.pt` model).

Run the following command to generate a basic `.spec` file:
```bash
pyinstaller --name parking_lot_classifier --onefile run_inference_pt_percentages.py
```

This will create a `.spec` file in your directory. You may need to modify it slightly to ensure the model file is included correctly.

#### Step 3: Modify the Spec File (Optional)
If the generated spec file doesnâ€™t include your model file, you can manually modify it. Open the `.spec` file and find the `datas` list. You need to add the model file path to it:
```python
# Modify the spec file's datas section to include your model
datas = [
    ('quantized_car_detection_cnn_scripted.pt', '.'),  # Include your quantized model
]

# Rest of the spec file remains unchanged
```

#### Step 4: Build the Executable
Run PyInstaller with the modified `.spec` file to create the executable:
```bash
pyinstaller car_detection_cnn.spec

pyinstaller car_detection_cnn.spec && cp dist/car_detection ../astro/db

```

This will generate a standalone executable in the `dist` directory.

#### Step 5: Transfer and Run on Raspberry Pi
Copy the executable (`dist/parking_lot_classifier`) to your Raspberry Pi and run it directly:
```bash
./parking_lot_classifier
```

### Key Considerations:
1. **Cross-Compilation**: If you're developing on a different architecture (e.g., x86 on a PC) than your target (e.g., ARM on a Raspberry Pi), you need to either:
   - Use a Raspberry Pi for packaging with PyInstaller.
   - Use a cross-compilation toolchain or Docker container set up for ARM builds.

2. **Dependencies**: PyInstaller bundles necessary Python dependencies. However, ensure that any external non-Python dependencies (like native libraries) are also included or available on the target system.

3. **Permissions**: Ensure the executable has execute permissions (`chmod +x parking_lot_classifier`).

### Using Other Tools:
- **Nuitka**: Compiles Python code to C and then compiles to a native binary, potentially improving performance.
- **PyOxidizer**: Can create Rust-based executables with embedded Python, offering more control over the packaging and dependencies.

These steps should provide you with a self-contained executable that doesn't require Python or virtual environment dependencies, making it straightforward to run your model on the Raspberry Pi.
